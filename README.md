# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

## Objective

Day and night, the roadway is filled with uncountable vehicles. People who travel long distances and those who operate heavy machinery all experience sleep deprivation. Consequently, driving while drowsy is quite risky. The reason for the majority of accidents is the drowsiness of the driver. Continuous driving can be tedious and exhausting. A driver may get drowsy and perhaps nod off due to inactivity. In this project, I've developed a drowsy driver detection system to address such an issue.
